# I. Introduction

## Genesis

The concept of _Carbon Brainprint_ was born during Mantu’s _Impackathon_, a company-wide initiative aimed at fostering sustainable business innovations. This project emerged as the competition’s winner, showcasing its potential to drive meaningful sustainability efforts. Winning the _Impackathon_ not only validated the concept but also provided the necessary resources and support to develop _Carbon Brainprint_ into a powerful tool.

Initially, the idea was to provide environmental impact data to Mantu Group’s clients, with Mantu diverse brands working primarily in intellectual services. Over time, the ambition expanded to making _Carbon Brainprint_ a market-wide tool, accelerating the decarbonization of the sector and enabling better decision-making in intellectual service practices.

Despite their intangible nature, intellectual services generate a measurable environmental impact, notably through consultants’ daily commutes, business travel, office-related emissions, and the broader corporate and administrative footprint of organizations.

## Objectives

Today, _Carbon Brainprint_ aims to be a precise tool for measuring the carbon footprint of intellectual services while also supporting informed decision-making for effective project decarbonization.

To maximize its impact, we believe in publishing _Carbon Brainprint_ as an open-source tool. This approach allows for standardized comparisons of practices across competitors, suppliers, and service providers over time. A standardized methodology ensures reliable benchmarking, facilitating continuous improvement in sustainability efforts.

The tool is designed for ongoing enhancement. Following multiple iterations within Mantu and its various brands to fine-tune its functionalities, we now seek external feedback. Your insights, reflections, and contributions are essential to evolving _Carbon Brainprint_ to accurately reflect the real-world emissions associated with our professional practices.

## Who can use it?

The _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology is designed for broad applicability across **all intellectual services**, ensuring a standardized approach to measuring and reducing carbon footprints. It is particularly relevant for industries that rely on knowledge-based expertise and professional services.

Sectors that can benefit from this methodology include, but are not limited to:

✔️  **Consulting** – Strategy, management, IT, and operational consulting firms.  
✔️  **Market Research & Competitive Intelligence** – Data analytics, consumer insights, and trend forecasting.  
✔️  **Scientific Research** – R&D organizations, innovation labs, and academic research institutions.  
✔️  **Accounting & Auditing** – Financial advisory, tax consulting, and compliance auditing.  
✔️  **Communication & Marketing** – Advertising agencies, media strategy, and corporate communication services.
✔️  **Legal Services** – Law firms, regulatory compliance advisory.

By applying _Carbon Brainprint_ across these industries, organizations can **assess, compare, and improve** their environmental impact, fostering more sustainable business practices in the intellectual services sector.

## How to use it?

The effectiveness of _Carbon Brainprint_ depends on the user. We have identified two primary target groups:

1.  **Providers of intellectual services**
2.  **Buyers of intellectual services**

**For Service Providers:**

_Carbon Brainprint_ is useful at two key stages of a project’s lifecycle:

-   **Pre-sales Phase:**  
    Before a project begins, users can estimate its carbon footprint based on predefined assumptions. The tool enables an initial quantified assessment of emissions across key project components, including business travel, consultant commuting, office-related emissions, and procurement activities.  
    By analyzing the distribution of emissions, service providers can take proactive steps to minimize their environmental impact—such as optimizing travel, reducing redundant material purchases, and making more sustainable logistical choices.
-   **Post-project Analysis:**  
    At the project’s conclusion, all decisions and actions have been implemented, allowing for a final, data-driven carbon footprint calculation based on actual consumption and activities. This stage provides the most accurate and reliable data, enabling suppliers to report the final carbon impact of their service delivery.

Clients can integrate this primary data into their own carbon accounting (Scope 3, Category: Purchased Goods and Services), improving the precision of their sustainability reporting. To ensure transparency and credibility, we encourage intellectual service providers to complement their reporting with a _Carbon Footprint Product_ report, aligned with ISO 14067 standards. This report will detail assumptions, data sources, and the quality of information used in the assessment.

**For Clients (Service Buyers):**

Clients can leverage _Carbon Brainprint_ in two key ways:

-   **Enhancing Scope 3 Reporting Accuracy:**  
    Clients can calculate the emissions associated with their primary intellectual service providers, replacing generic monetary-based estimations with precise carbon footprint data.
-   **Comparing Supplier Performance:**  
    The tool allows clients to measure and compare suppliers’ environmental performance over time, using a standardized carbon intensity metric for intellectual services. Additionally, during procurement processes, _Carbon Brainprint_ enables fair comparisons between service providers under equal conditions, using predefined assessment criteria to evaluate the carbon footprint of proposed projects.

By integrating _Carbon Brainprint_ into procurement and reporting strategies, companies can drive industry-wide transparency and sustainability improvements.

# II. Conceptual framework

## Standards followed

_Carbon Brainprint_ was developed using a combination of **recognized international standards**, ensuring **rigor, reliability, and alignment** with best practices in carbon accounting and life cycle assessments.

**Key Standards Referenced:**

1.  **Corporate Carbon Footprint Calculation:**

-   **GHG Protocol Corporate Standard** – Provides a framework for measuring and managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the organizational level.
-   **ISO 14064-1** – Standard for quantifying, monitoring, and reporting GHG emissions at the company level.

2.  **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA):**

-   **ISO 14044** – Defines principles and frameworks for conducting life cycle assessments, ensuring a **comprehensive approach** to evaluating environmental impacts.
-   **GHG Protocol Product Standard** – Used to refine specific assumptions regarding the **carbon footprint of services**.

3.  **Product Carbon footprint:**

-   **ISO 14067 -** Specifies principles, requirements, and guidelines for quantifying and reporting the carbon footprint of products (CFP). It provides a standardized approach to assessing life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

## Differences from traditional carbon footprint calculations

_Carbon Brainprint_ functions as a **Carbon Footprint Product (CFP)**, specifically adapted for **intellectual services**, distinguishing it from a **traditional organizational carbon footprint**. While both concepts are closely related, they differ in their scope, methodology, and application.

**Key Differences:**

1.  **Service-Based vs. Organizational Carbon Footprint:**

-   A **traditional carbon footprint** evaluates an **organization's overall emissions**, including energy use, logistics, and supply chain activities.
-   _Carbon Brainprint_, as a **service-oriented CFP**, reallocates an organization’s emissions at a **granular project level**, providing insights into the carbon impact of each intellectual service delivered.

2.  **Inclusion of Support Functions:**

-   In **product-based CFPs**, certain **organizational functions** (e.g., administrative operations, office-related activities) may be excluded as they are not directly tied to the final product and not considered material.
-   In **intellectual services**, these elements **constitute the core of the service itself** (e.g., consultant commuting, office-related emissions, and IT infrastructure), making their inclusion **critical for accuracy**.

3.  **Methodological Adaptation:**

-   Traditional **CFPs for physical products** focus on raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, and end-of-life impacts.
-   For _Carbon Brainprint_, the approach is adapted to **service-related emissions**, ensuring that:  
    ✔ Consultant travel, remote work, and office activities are **properly accounted for**.
    ✔ Emissions are **allocated per project**, allowing for a **detailed and actionable footprint** at the service level.

## Systematic approach

Our _Carbon Brainprint_ calculator has been strategically developed to enable **detailed, project-specific assessments**, ensuring precision and adaptability in carbon footprint analysis.

Aligned with **ISO 14067**, our methodology follows the **CFP systematic approach** outlined in **Annex C** of the standard. This ensures a **structured, repeatable, and verifiable** method for calculating greenhouse gas emissions related to intellectual services.

**Key features of the systematic approach:**

-   **Dynamic user interface:** The calculator guides users through inputting project-specific parameters, including:

	-   **Project duration**
	-   **Entity/location concerned**
	-   **Business travel details** (modes, distances, and locations)
	-   **Remote work percentage**
	-   **Consultant commuting details** (daily distance traveled and transport modes)

-   **Automated calculation adjustments:** The tool dynamically **adapts calculations** based on the specific conditions of each project, ensuring **tailored and accurate carbon footprint estimates**.

**Benefits of the Systematic Approach:**

1.  **Consistent Monitoring & Management**

-   Enables **annual tracking of environmental performance** at both project and organizational levels.
-   Enhances **comparability** across projects and reporting periods.

2.  **Scalability & organizational efficiency**

-   Allows for **replication across multiple projects**, ensuring a **standardized approach** to carbon footprint product assessments.
-   Reduces redundancy by applying **the same dataset and allocation procedures** across all relevant projects.

3.  **Streamlined verification process**

-   **Simplifies external audits** by avoiding duplication in data verification.
-   Establishes **clear procedures** for the **operation, control, and monitoring** of the _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology.

By implementing this **CFP systematic approach**, we ensure that our carbon footprint calculations are **transparent and repeatable.**

## Responsibilities allocation recommendation

A structured and coordinated approach is essential to ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and effective deployment of _Carbon Brainprint_. The following recommended roles and responsibilities are key to its successful implementation:

**1. Sustainability experts**

The **sustainability expert** is responsible for:

-   **Developing and maintaining the systematic calculation template** used for _Carbon Brainprint_.
-   **Updating the Carbon Brainprint calculation annually**, ensuring alignment with the latest environmental standards and emissions factors.
-   **Reviewing and refining the methodology** to maintain consistency with existing calculation tools and emission factors.

The knowledge of the **sustainability expert** is critical for:

-   Ensuring **methodological accuracy** and alignment with best practices in environmental assessments.
-   Maintaining a **high level of environmental expertise**, essential for correctly interpreting, applying, and evolving the methodology.

**2. Business Teams**

The **Business Teams** play a key role in the external communication and operational deployment of _Carbon Brainprint_. Their responsibilities include:

-   **Effectively communicating the tool to clients**, ensuring they understand its value and how it applies to their projects.
-   **Coordinating with sustainability teams** to ensure accurate and consistent messaging.

-   **Integrating _Carbon Brainprint_ results into project evaluations**, enabling informed decision-making and sustainability-driven strategies.

# III. Step-by-Step methodology

This methodology presents the most complex scenario for calculating the carbon footprint of intellectual services: assessing emissions at the **entity level across a group of consolidated entities**. A comparable approach can be applied when analyzing emissions **at the office level within a single entity**. In simpler cases—such as when a single entity represents the entire organization—the same methodological steps remain relevant, though with simplified allocation processes.

# Framing the analysis

## a. Goal & scope (time and geography)

The first step in a _Carbon Brainprint_ assessment is to clearly define the **goal and scope** of the analysis. These elements vary depending on the organization and the intended use of the results.

The **goal** may differ based on the stakeholder:

-   For **providers of intellectual services**, the objective may be to offer clients visibility into the **environmental performance of their projects**.
-   For **buyers of intellectual services**, the purpose could be to **compare the performance** of a supplier over time or to benchmark **multiple suppliers** against each other.
-   Other potential objectives include gaining insights into the **distribution of emissions** across the service lifecycle or identifying **priority areas for decarbonization**.

Two types of scope must also be defined:

**1. Geographical Scope**

This covers all **countries and locations** where the entities included in the calculation operate. It ensures that local operational differences, such as energy mixes and transport infrastructure, are appropriately accounted for.

**2. Temporal Scope**

This defines the **validity period of the data** used in the calculation. It is recommended to **update the analysis annually**.

The _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology is typically based on **prior-year data (N-1)**. This is due to the dependency on finalized and consolidated organizational carbon footprint data, which is generally only available at the end of a reporting year.

For example, in 2025, the assessment would rely on **2024 carbon data**, as it would be the most recent validated dataset. The same principle applies to the use of **emission factors**, which should also reflect the most current available year.

## b. Product system

Once the goal and scope have been defined, the next step is to identify the **precise service being analyzed**, ensuring that it qualifies as an _intellectual service_. Only services based primarily on human expertise and knowledge contribution are compatible with the _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology.

For example, within Mantu, the tool was deployed across several brands and business lines. One brand provides both digital agency services and consulting. _Carbon Brainprint_ was applied exclusively to **consulting activities**, as these involve a direct intellectual contribution. In contrast, for services resulting in tangible deliverables—such as applications or web pages—a traditional **product life cycle assessment (LCA)** methodology is more appropriate.

**Illustrative example – Product system in consulting:**

-   **Product system description:**  
    “A consultant is asked to intellectually contribute to a project for a client from a computer at the client’s premises.”
-   **Function of the product system:**  
    “Delivering expert knowledge or advice in a specific area of the client's project.”

## c. Functional unit and reference flow

The **functional unit** is a key concept in life cycle assessment, defining the **quantified performance of a product system** for use as a reference. It provides a consistent basis for calculating and comparing environmental impacts.

**Functional unit (Consulting context):**

-   Defined as: One consulting project
-   A consulting project is characterized as an **intellectual contribution** delivered by one or more consultants, defined over a specific period and measured in **consulting days (consultant man-days)**.
-   Consultant man-days are the standard **unit of measurement and invoicing** in the consulting industry, making them a suitable and consistent metric for this CFP study.

## d. Reference flow

The **reference flow** includes the inputs and outputs required to fulfill the defined functional unit—i.e., delivering one consulting project.

-   **Inputs:**

	-   Number of consulting days (consultant man-days)
	-   Percentage of remote work (work-from-home rate)
	-   Business travel details:
		- Distance traveled and transport mode _or_
		-   City of departure and arrival, transport mode
		-   Country of stay and number of hotel nights
	-   IT equipment used (specifying whether provided by the consulting firm or the client)
	-   Commuting habits: daily distance traveled per consultant and transport mode

-   **Output:**

	-   Greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project, expressed in **kg CO₂e**

The **reference flow is consistent with the functional unit**, as it captures the complete set of variables necessary to deliver one consulting project. This ensures that the carbon footprint results are **directly linked to a defined, measurable, and comparable service unit**, which is critical for decision-making and reporting.

## e. Setting the boundaries and building the cartography

The **system boundary** defines the processes and emission sources included in the scope of a Carbon Footprint Product (CFP) study. It outlines the extent of the life cycle of the service delivered and determines the environmental impacts to be considered during the service’s life cycle.

**Initial life cycle mapping**

The boundary-setting process begins with a comprehensive **life cycle mapping**, developed using a **multi-stakeholder approach**. Inputs from presales teams, business operations, clients, and external experts should be used to identify all relevant activities involved in the delivery of the service—ranging from organizational readiness to actual execution.

This collaborative mapping ensures a **complete representation of the service life cycle** and helps recognize the full set of processes that contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is recommended that this cartography be **tailored to the specific business model** of the organization. For example, in a multi-brand group structure, a separate life cycle map should be established for each brand to reflect variations in delivery models and business operations.

**Refining the emissions framework**

Following the mapping, each identified activity is translated into **quantifiable GHG emissions**, with direct links to specific **emission categories**. This step ensures that each operational stage corresponds to a measurable emissions source. **It is recommended to identify and document the links between the service life cycle stages and the corresponding emission categories from the organization's overall carbon footprint.** This alignment ensures consistency between product-level (CFP) and organization-level (CFA) assessments and facilitates data traceability.

Each activity is:

-   Mapped to a relevant **GHG emission source**,
-   Quantified using appropriate **emission factors**,
-   Combined with other indicators to enhance **data granularity** at the service level.

**Coverage of direct and indirect emissions**

The boundary-setting process includes both **direct and indirect emissions** across the value chain. The methodology is designed to be **iterative and adaptable**, allowing for updates based on changes in service delivery models or newly identified impact areas.

At this stage, it is important to emphasize that, unlike product-based life cycle assessments—where **cut-off criteria** can sometimes be applied to exclude emissions from support or administrative functions—such exclusions are **not appropriate** when assessing the carbon footprint of intellectual services using the _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology. In service-based contexts, the **materiality of the project often lies within the enabling operations themselves**, including activities from sales, human resources, finance, and other corporate support functions. These functions are essential for delivering the service and thus must be considered as **integral parts of the service life cycle**. In practice, it has been observed that **upstream emissions** linked to the organizational and administrative setup can account for a **significant portion of the total footprint**—in some cases, up to **80%**. Therefore, _Carbon Brainprint_ requires a **comprehensive inclusion of all relevant functions**, ensuring that emissions are accurately attributed and that the final assessment reflects the full reality of service delivery impacts.

**Life cycle stages and system boundary definition**

It is recommended to develop a **visual process map** that clearly represents all life cycle stages and their associated emission categories. Structuring the map according to classical LCA stages—**Cradle to Gate to Grave**—facilitates transparency, stakeholder communication, and alignment with verification frameworks.

The following mapping can be used as an example, in a consulting industry setting: https://carbonbrainprint.com/methodology 

The consulting service life cycle presented above is categorized into three stages, in line with the "cradle-to-grave" LCA framework:

**From Cradle to Gate**

**1. Administrative/Corporate Context**  
Covers all upstream activities required for service enablement, including:

-   Office operations: heating, cooling, lighting, and waste management
-   Support functions: HR, Finance, legal, etc.
-   Procurement of services and materials for day-to-day operations

**2. Pre-processing of the Service**  
Involves activities preparing the consulting service, such as:

-   Business team commuting (daily transport to and from office)
-   Business travel by business or sales teams (e.g., client visits, pre-sales activities)
-   Use of company-leased vehicles

**From Gate to Grave**

**3. Use of the Service**  
Encompasses the actual delivery of the service, including:

-   Emissions from consultant computer use
-   Consultant business travel (flights, trains, hotels) and night stays
-   On-site project delivery activities

This life cycle definition is consistent with the **GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard**, which notes that for services, **production and use stages may be merged into a single ‘service delivery’ stage**. This consolidation is applied here.

The **end-of-life stage** has been **excluded** from this assessment. In the context of intellectual services, post-delivery impacts—such as the usage, archiving, or disposal of deliverables—are **outside the operational scope** of the service provider and fall under the **client’s responsibility** within their own carbon footprint. The **core function** of the product system is defined as the **intellectual contribution** provided by consultants to a client’s project, specifically through the delivery of knowledge, expertise, and strategic or technical advice. Once the service is delivered, any further lifecycle stages associated with the deliverables are **beyond the control and visibility** of the service provider and are therefore excluded from the system boundary.

The definition of system boundaries is **not static**. To maintain accuracy and relevance, it is recommended to conduct **annual reviews** of the boundary selection. This ensures that the CFP study reflects any **changes in service delivery models**, newly introduced activities, or evolving operational practices.

# Data management

## a. Data Collection

The _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology relies on multiple datasets, sourced from both organizational carbon footprint data and operational metrics. The quality, granularity, and traceability of these datasets directly impact the reliability of the final CFP results.

**Required data sets include:**

-   **Organizational Carbon Footprint Assessment (CFA):**  
    Conducted in accordance with recognized standards such as the GHG Protocol or ADEME’s Bilan Carbone.
-   **Headcount Data:**

	-   Headcount per entity
	-   Headcount per office
	-   Total company headcount if different from the sum of included entities

-   **Financial Data:**

	-   Revenue data covering the same period as the CFA
	-   Revenue per entity included
	-   Total company revenue (if applicable)

-   **Consultants Using Company-Provided IT Equipment:**

	-   Total number per entity or office

-   **Distance Matrix Data:**

	-   Default: Calculated using the **Google Maps API**
	-   Exceptions: For locations not supported by the API, distances are calculated using the **Haversine formula** (great-circle distance)

## b. Emission factors sources

**Primary Data (Preferred):**

Emission factors directly provided by suppliers (e.g., electricity providers, HVAC maintenance, purchased goods) should be used when available, provided they are based on rigorous, documented methodologies.

**Secondary Data (Recommended databases):**

When primary data is unavailable, factors should be sourced from recognized open-access databases:

-   **ADEME** and **DEFRA** – Cover the majority of GHG Protocol categories
-   **IEA** – Used for electricity upstream emissions and T&D losses
-   **PCAF** – Used for building infrastructure upstream emissions
-   **Association of Issuing Bodies** – For Scope 2 residual mix emission factors (location-based method)

**Global Warming Potentials (GWPs):**

-   Based on the **IPCC 6th Assessment Report**
-   100-year time horizon
-   Sourced via ADEME database

_Annual review of emission factors is mandatory_, following the update of the calculation model and activity data.

## c. Data quality assessment

Ensuring high-quality data is critical for delivering credible CFP results. The following practices are recommended:

**Validation and verification:**

-   Ideally, the **organizational CFA should be verified under ISO 14064-1** to ensure downstream data reliability in the CFP tool.
-   Use **validated financial data**, preferably audited.
-   Limit manual intervention by leveraging existing HR and IT systems for employee and equipment data.

**Systematic quality checks:**

-   Implement **automated outlier detection** and **uncertainty analysis**.
-   Track **data type percentages** (primary, monetary, estimated, physical).
-   If **estimated data exceeds 5%** of total emissions at the project level, a **warning is triggered** and corrective action plans should be initiated.
-   The final user is ultimately responsible for accepting or rejecting data above the estimation threshold for Scope 3 integration.

**Annual review:**

-   Complements any audit process
-   Identifies model improvements
-   Enhances automation and simplify complex manual calculations

## d. Management of outliers and extreme values

In large-scale deployments (e.g., across many entities), **significant variations** in project-level carbon intensity may appear. Two scenarios are possible:

**Scenario 1 – Valid outlier:**

After investigation, if the outlier reflects reality, the value is retained.

Interpretation: The entity may require additional decarbonization efforts to align with peers.

**Scenario 2 – Data anomaly or structural bias:**

Outlier may result from misallocated emissions (e.g., large IT purchases charged to a single entity).

**Preferred action:** Reallocate the data across relevant entities based on operational realities.  
**Fallback:** Replace the extreme value with:

-   Average value from a geographically or operationally similar entity
-   Global average across all entities (only as a last resort)

This data management framework supports the **credibility, transparency, and continuous improvement** of the Carbon Brainprint methodology and ensures consistency with established carbon accounting standards.

# Building the calculation tool

The _Carbon Brainprint_ calculator can be built using a standard spreadsheet tool such as **Microsoft Excel**. The tool is designed with a **modular structure**, divided into distinct categories to ensure transparency, traceability, and adaptability to different projects or entities.

	- **Breakdown by entity**:
		- Emissions (kgCO₂e) by entity
		- Associated uncertainty levels


**3. Data sheets**

These sheets support the model by centralizing **source data and conversion factors**:

-   **Emission factors**:

	-   Contains indices and units for all emission factors used

-   **Data import from CFA**:

	-   Imports data from the verified organizational **carbon footprint assessment (CFA)**
	-   Can be powered by **Excel Power Query**

-   **Allocation data**:

	-   Includes HR and finance data from company reporting

-   **Additional data**:

	-   **Distance matrix** (e.g., between offices)
	-   **Etc.**

**4. Calculation sheets**

These sheets carry out all computational tasks in three stages:

-   **Indicator calculations**:

	-   Calculates emissions at the **most granular level possible**
	-   Includes raw emissions per activity category

-   **Allocation calculations**:

	-   Allocates emissions by **entity, brand, geography**, etc.
	-   Converts total emissions into **intensity per reference unit** (e.g., per consulting day)

-   **Final calculations**:

	-   Aggregates all results by life cycle stage
	-   Provides final carbon intensity and **uncertainty scores**
	-   Breaks down data **by project and entity**

**5. Complementary analysis**

-   **Uncertainty analysis**:

	-   Evaluates uncertainty per emission category and per entity

-   **Sensitivity analysis**:

	-   Assesses the impact of **data inputs or allocation choices**
	-   Demonstrates the robustness of CFP results under different assumptions

## b. Worked example – office emissions allocation

To illustrate how the tool functions, let's take the example of offices CO2e emissions:

1.  **Scope definition**  
    In the "Introduction" sheet, the **office** category includes:

	-   Electricity (including upstream & T&D losses)
	-   Gas consumption (upstream included)
	-   Office waste
	-   Fugitive emissions from air conditioning

2.  **Data consolidation**  
    These data points are retrieved from the **CFA database**
3.  **Emission indicators**  
    Office-related emissions by country are calculated in the **"Indicator calculations"** sheet.
4.  **Allocation by entity**  
    In the **"Allocation calculations"** sheet, office emissions are:

	-   Allocated across entities
	-   Divided by the number of consulting days to obtain a per-day per -entity emission factor

7.  **Final output**  
    In the **"Final calculations"** sheet, the emission factor per consulting day is:

	-   Multiplied by the number of project consulting days
	-   Integrated into the total project footprint alongside the other indicators.

This modular and transparent structure ensures that the _Carbon Brainprint_ tool can be **audited, scaled, and adapted** to a wide range of intellectual service delivery contexts. It also facilitates data traceability, stakeholder communication, and alignment with ISO 14067 requirements.

# Allocation rules

The methodologies presented below are used within the _Carbon Brainprint_ calculation tool to ensure the accurate allocation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when emission sources are shared across multiple processes—such as different brands, entities, or geographical scopes. These rules aim to maintain both transparency and reproducibility when quantifying emissions associated with service delivery.

The examples provided reflect specific operational contexts and must be adapted to the **data availability and business reality** of each user organization.

Two main allocation logics are applied:

**1. Allocation based on turnover**

This method is applied when **environmental impacts are proportionally linked to the economic value** generated by a service or activity. It is particularly suited for emissions from **non-business corporate functions**, which serve the entire organization and are not confined to specific projects or brands.

**Emission categories that include non-business corporate functions:**

-   Office-related emissions
-   Car fleet emissions
-   Purchased goods and services
-   IT equipment emissions
-   Non-business staff commuting emissions

These emissions are allocated based on each entity’s **share of total group turnover**, then normalized by the **number of consulting days** in that entity to reflect service intensity.

**Formula:**

1.  Calculate the **turnover ratio**:

Entity turnover ÷ Total group turnover

2.  Allocate emissions accordingly:

(Total emissions × Turnover ratio) ÷ Total consulting days in the entity

This approach ensures that entities generating more economic output are assigned a proportionate share of the emissions associated with shared corporate functions.

**2. Allocation based on headcount**

This method is used when emissions are **more directly linked to human activity**, particularly in cases where emissions correlate with the **number of employees** rather than financial output.

**Applicable emission categories:**

-   Office emissions
-   Employee commuting emissions

These emissions are often reported at the **office or country level**, rather than by entity. In shared spaces or multi-entity offices, reassigning emissions at a granular level can introduce inaccuracies. Therefore, emissions are allocated based on **employee headcount per entity within a given country**.

This approach is consistent with **ISO 14067 guidance**, which advises minimizing excessive reallocation where it does not significantly improve the accuracy of the assessment.

**Formula:**

1.  Calculate the **headcount ratio**:

Number of employees in the entity ÷ Total number of employees in the country

2.  Allocate emissions accordingly:

(Total emissions × Headcount ratio) ÷ Total consulting days in the entity

This method provides a **simplified yet robust** approach to allocating operational emissions where direct attribution is impractical.

These allocation methodologies enhance the precision and consistency of the _Carbon Brainprint_ tool while remaining flexible enough to adapt to a variety of organizational structures and data maturity levels. Regular review of these methods is recommended to reflect changes in organizational design, service delivery models, or data availability.

# **Interpretation and analysis**

Once the impact assessment is complete, it is essential to conduct a detailed **interpretation of the results** to identify key insights and actionable outcomes.

## a. **Life cycle emissions distribution**

The first level of analysis involves examining the **distribution of emissions across the life cycle stages** of the project. This helps identify the **most emission-intensive phases**, such as pre-operational activities, service delivery, or consultant travel. Understanding where emissions are concentrated enables the identification of **targeted decarbonization opportunities**.

## b.  **Variable sensitivity and optimization**

A second area of analysis focuses on the **adjustment of project variables**—such as the number of consulting days, travel frequency, or remote work ratio. By simulating changes to these inputs, users can test potential **reduction scenarios** and identify additional **levers for lowering the carbon footprint** of similar projects.

## c. **Communication and recommendations**

When sharing results with **internal or external stakeholders**, it is recommended to present findings alongside **separate decarbonization recommendations**. This facilitates informed discussion around **best practices** and encourages collaboration on implementing **realistic and context-specific mitigation measures**.

This interpretive process supports continuous improvement, fosters transparency, and helps integrate sustainability considerations into operational and strategic decision-making.

# Validation & accuracy

## a. Documenting assumptions

In any carbon footprint assessment, assumptions should be **minimized** and used **only when primary data is unavailable**. When estimates are necessary, they must be based on **historical data**, activity data, **industry benchmarks**, or **validated secondary sources**, ensuring a model that reflects reality as closely as possible.

All assumptions must be:

-   **Clearly documented**
-   **Mapped to specific life cycle stages**
-   **Shared transparently with stakeholders**, including clients

This practice enhances credibility, traceability, and alignment with ISO 14067 and GHG Protocol requirements.

The following list serves as **example of typical assumptions used in a Carbon Brainprint calculator in a consulting industry setting.**

**1. Administrative / corporate context**

-   **IT equipment:**

	-   Consultants may use equipment provided either by the company or by the client. When the client provides the equipment, associated emissions are excluded to avoid double counting.
	-   IT equipment is assumed to require software to function and emissions linked to software are included accordingly.

-   **Exclusion of non-relevant activities:**

	-   Emission categories from business lines that do not fall under intellectual services are excluded from the assessment.

-   **Car fleet emissions (non-business staff):**

	-   Only vehicles registered under the relevant entity (e.g., Entity X) are included.

-   **Electricity:**

	-   All electricity emissions are calculated using the **market-based approach**.

-   **Purchased goods and services (excluding IT equipment):**

	-   These are fully attributed to the supporting entity (100% allocation).
	-   It is assumed that purchased goods and services are acquired and consumed in the same reporting year. In cases of atypical procurement spikes, this assumption can be revised to reflect operational reality.

**2. Pre-processing of the service**

-   100% of short-term car fleet leasing is attributed to the specific entity (e.g., Entity X).
-   100% of the car fleet emissions linked to an entity are assumed to result from use by business staff.

**3. Use of the service**

-   Consultants are assumed to work primarily from the **client's premises**.
-   Emissions occurring at the client's premises are **excluded** to prevent double counting within the client’s 	own carbon accounting.
-   Emissions from **computer usage** are only accounted for during **remote work** (e.g., working from home), to avoid overlap with the client’s Scope 2 reporting.
-   When no specific commuting data is available, **proxy values** are used, based on the **average daily commuting emissions** of the entity.

**4. Consultant commuting**

-   It is assumed that consultants **do not use company cars** for commuting.

**5. Allocation assumptions**

-   Office spaces are often shared among multiple brands and entities.
-   Non-business staff (e.g., HR, finance) are assumed to support **all business operations** equally.
-   The number of consulting days is calculated as:

By clearly documenting these assumptions, organizations can maintain **data integrity**, support **audit readiness**, and provide stakeholders with a transparent view of how emissions were calculated. It also allows for consistent updates and refinements as more precise data becomes available.

## b. Data limitations and corrective action plans

After calculations, a **thorough review of data limitations** is necessary to guide future improvements. Common limitations and corresponding action plans include:

**a. Business travel attribution by client:**

Business travel tools often lack client-level granularity.

_Interim Solution:_ Calculate average emissions from business travel per consultant-day at the entity level.  
_Action Plan:_ Improve booking tools or data collection processes to assign trips to specific clients.

**b. Data type distribution accuracy:**

CFPs often rely on the CFA’s distribution between primary, monetary, and estimated data.

_Action Plan:_ Collaborate closely with the CFA lead to refine input categories and improve data quality year over year.

**c. Commuting data from consultants:**

Direct commuting data is most reliable but can be difficult to obtain, for instance when a high number of people work on a project.

_Fallback Option:_ Use commuting profiles provided by the client, assuming consultants mirror the client’s commuting behavior.  
_Last Resort:_ Apply average commuting emissions of the consultant’s entity.  
_Action Plan:_ Develop mechanisms for direct commuting data collection and promote decarbonization actions (e.g., remote work, low-emission mobility).

_Note:_ Limitations must be **transparently disclosed to clients** in any CFP-related communication to preserve trust and credibility.

## c. ISO 14067 verification

To ensure the correct application of the calculation model and the quality of underlying data, a _Carbon Brainprint_ assessment may undergo **third-party verification in accordance with ISO 14067**.

This verification process confirms:

-   The **methodological compliance** of the tool
-   The **integrity and traceability of input data**
-   The robustness of the **impact assessment documentation**

For example, this verification approach has been applied to the _Carbon Brainprint_ tool used by **Amaris Consulting**, a brand of the Mantu Group.

**Recommended steps for ISO 14067 verification:**

1.  **Acquire the ISO 14067 standard**

-   It is strongly recommended to purchase and review the standard to ensure all **documentary and methodological requirements** are met.

3.  **Engage an accredited third-party verifier**

-   Use a qualified **ISO 14067 verification provider** to conduct an external audit of the tool and supporting documentation.

This process enhances **credibility, transparency, and alignment with international standards**, supporting the tool’s use in sustainability reporting and client disclosures.

## d. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis

To ensure the reliability and relevance of carbon footprint data, an **uncertainty and sensitivity analysis** is conducted as part of the _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology. These analyses provide essential insights into the **confidence level** of the results and the **impact of methodological choices** on final outcomes.

**Uncertainty analysis**

The uncertainty analysis follows the guidance outlined in the **GHG Protocol uncertainty assessment framework** and focuses on **parameter uncertainty**, i.e., uncertainty related to **emission factors** and **activity data**.

**Key concepts:**

-   **Individual uncertainty** refers to the uncertainty of each emission input (activity data and emission factors).
-   **Aggregated uncertainty** is the statistical combination of individual uncertainties, representing the total uncertainty of the model. The **Gaussian aggregation method** is used to perform this calculation.

A distinction is made between:

-   **Directly measured emissions** – based on specific activity data and associated emission factors.
-   **Indirectly measured emissions** – derived from broader data points or approximated using proxy values.

Uncertainties for both types are **calculated and tracked separately** for each emission category until the final aggregation stage.

**Case 1: Uncertainty not calculated in the Carbon Footprint Assessment (CFA)**

If the organizational CFA did not calculate uncertainty, then both **individual and aggregated uncertainties** must be calculated within the _Carbon Brainprint_ model.

**Case 2: Uncertainty already calculated in the CFA**

When the CFA has already included uncertainty:

-   Initial uncertainty values are **imported from the CFA**.
-   The main task becomes **reallocating country-level emissions and uncertainties** to the relevant entities.

A pivot-based calculation approach is applied:

-   For each emission category, both **directly and indirectly measured squared auxiliary variables** are gathered.
-   The **auxiliary variable** is calculated from the squared product of the emissions and the uncertainty for each data point.
-   This enables a distinct aggregation process for _Carbon Brainprint_ compared to CFA.

**Reporting and outputs:**

-   **Uncertainty by emission category:** Identifies which categories contribute most to overall uncertainty.
-   **Uncertainty by entity:**

-   First, total direct and indirect uncertainties are calculated per entity.
-   Then, a **final uncertainty value per entity** is computed using the **Gaussian aggregation formula**.

-   **Final project uncertainty:** In the user interface, the tool calculates a **weighted average uncertainty** across all selected entities, based on their respective emissions.

**Sensitivity analysis**

In accordance with **ISO 14067**, sensitivity analysis is carried out when **alternative allocation methods** could reasonably be used. In the _Carbon Brainprint_ methodology, two allocation logics are employed depending on the emission category:

-   **Headcount-based allocation** (e.g., for office-related emissions)
-   **Turnover-based allocation** (e.g., for non-business staff functions)

To assess sensitivity:

1.  **Swap the allocation method** (e.g., apply turnover allocation where headcount was used, and vice versa).
2.  **Calculate the sensitivity ratio** for each entity using the formula:

Sensitivity Ratioᵢ = A_alt,ᵢ / A_init,ᵢ

Where:

- `A_init,i`: initial allocation for entity *i*  
- `A_alt,i`: alternative allocation for entity *i*


3.  **Analyze results:**

-   A **mean sensitivity ratio close to 1** suggests low sensitivity between the two methods.
-   A **high standard deviation** in the sensitivity ratios indicates greater variation and **higher sensitivity** to the chosen allocation method.

**Interpretation:**

A high sensitivity indicates that the choice of allocation logic **significantly affects results**, highlighting the importance of selecting the most context-appropriate method. This information helps assess the **robustness** of the model and guides methodological decisions in future assessments.

# Quality control and assurance

The quality assurance framework for the _Carbon Brainprint_ is designed to ensure the **reliability, transparency, and consistency** of the calculation model. It is grounded in **annual reviews, structured internal audits**, and adherence to international standards, particularly **ISO 14067** and **ISO/TS 14071**.

This process should involve a **multi-disciplinary team**, including sustainability professionals, internal auditors, and business representatives. Their diverse expertise ensures a comprehensive review from both a technical and operational perspective, contributing to continuous improvement of the methodology.

## a. Internal audit of the calculation model

At the beginning of each audit cycle, the Carbon Brainprint management team conducts a **training session** for the internal audit stakeholders. This training introduces:

-   The structure and logic of the calculation model
-   The methodological foundations
-   Audit expectations and procedures

Internal auditors are then provided with a standardized **audit template**, where they document any identified errors, inconsistencies, or areas of concern within the model.

## b. Gap analysis and CFP report review

After the initial model audit, the Carbon Brainprint management team and the ISO 14067 internal auditor perform a comprehensive **review of the Carbon Brainprint procedure and corresponding CFP report**.

This step aims to:

-   Verify alignment with **ISO 14067 documentation requirements**
-   Ensure the **clarity and usability** of documentation for external stakeholders
-   Capture detailed **auditor feedback** to support iterative enhancements

## c. Critical review in accordance with ISO/TS 14071

A **critical review** of the CFP study is conducted following the guidance of **ISO/TS 14071**, which provides best practices for ensuring **credibility and robustness** in life cycle-based assessments.

Each reviewer uses a structured **review template** based on ISO/TS 14071 to:

-   Systematically assess the study
-   Document findings
-   Recommend specific improvements

This process strengthens the scientific rigor of the CFP study and enhances stakeholder confidence in the results.

## d. Internal audit of the procedure and process

When applicable, following the CFP report review, a formal **internal audit** is conducted by the organization's **audit department** to assess procedural compliance with **ISO 14067**.

Steps include:

-   The internal auditor responsible for compliance prepares a **checklist** of audit points and identifies relevant auditees.
-   The audit evaluates the full **Carbon Brainprint process**, identifying:

	-   **Non-conformities**
	-   **Strengths**
	-   **Opportunities for improvement**

A final **internal audit report** is issued, and any identified gaps are addressed through **corrective action plans** to ensure readiness for a future **external verification**.

# Information management

The management of all documentation related to the _Carbon Brainprint_ tool—such as annual calculation models, procedures, and Carbon Footprint Product (CFP) reports—is critical to ensuring the **security, traceability, and integrity** of environmental data. This responsibility is overseen by the **Carbon Brainprint management team** and governed by a defined set of controls.

Access to sensitive documents is **restricted to authorized personnel only**, ensuring that all data handling complies with the highest standards of **confidentiality and information integrity**.

All collaborators with access are **trained not to modify** the documents. Any unauthorized modification detected will result in:

-   Immediate restoration to the most recent validated version
-   Follow-up with the responsible party by the Carbon Brainprint management team

The annual calculation model should be **password-protected** at the sheet level.

# Communication of the result

Once the _Carbon Brainprint_ tool and its results have undergone internal and external review, it is recommended to **communicate the Carbon Footprint Product (CFP) results and methodology both internally and externally**. This communication serves two primary purposes:

1.  **Engaging stakeholders** (internal and client-facing)
2.  **Supporting internal decision-making and environmental management**

## a.  Internal communication and use

Key resources should be shared across the organization to ensure proper use of the Carbon Brainprint tool and to support integration of environmental considerations into business operations. Recommended internal resources include:

-   **Detailed CFP results**: Offering a clear overview of environmental impacts and trends observed through the assessment
-   **Access to the Carbon Brainprint calculator**: Allowing operational and commercial teams to generate project-level emissions estimates
-   **Tutorial videos**: Supporting proper and consistent use of the calculator
-   **Frequently asked questions (FAQ)**: Addressing common questions and promoting proper interpretation of results

This approach ensures that every teams can confidently apply CFP data in their proposals, enhancing the **environmental relevance** and **credibility** of their offers.

To support efficient usage, it is recommended to establish a **standardized and automated process** for calculating results and generating supporting documentation. Further information on automation can be found in the _Use Case_ section.

## b. External communication

The primary external audience for CFP results is clients. Communicating environmental data supports **transparency**, strengthens **client relationships**, and contributes to client-side Scope 3 reporting.

**Communication formats:**

**CFP reports:**

-   **Pre-project (proposal phase):** A preliminary CFP report provides an estimate of expected emissions. This helps clients evaluate environmental impacts during the tendering phase.
-   **Post-project (delivery phase):** A final CFP report outlines actual project emissions, supporting client integration of the data into their own carbon accounting systems.

**Interactive formats:**

-   Live **presentations and demonstrations** of the Carbon Brainprint methodology may be delivered to clients upon request. These sessions enhance understanding of the methodology and the robustness of the data.

## c. CFP report issuance procedure

The process for issuing CFP reports is **collaboratively managed** between the business team and the Carbon Brainprint team.

**Roles and responsibilities**

**Business team:**

-   Completes mandatory training before using the tool or issuing reports
-   Prepares and delivers CFP reports to clients
-   Serves as the main contact for client communication and explanations

**Carbon Brainprint team:**

-   Provides training on methodology, data interpretation, and quality control

This comprehensive documentation allows both internal and external stakeholders to understand and evaluate the carbon footprint of a given service or project with confidence.

# IV. Limitations & Considerations

While _Carbon Brainprint_ provides a robust and comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with intellectual services, several limitations should be acknowledged:

**1. Exclusion of the End-of-Life Stage**

Given the **intangible nature** of consulting services, there is no conventional **end-of-life phase** that generates emissions, such as product disposal or decommissioning. As a result, this stage is not included in our calculations, which we recognize as a limitation of our assessment.

**2. Focus on Greenhouse Gas Emissions**

The _Carbon Footprint Product (CFP)_ primarily quantifies **GHG emissions** related to climate change. However, it does not encompass **other environmental impacts**, such as:

-   **Resource depletion** (e.g., water and energy consumption)
-   **Ecosystem degradation**
-   **Biodiversity loss**

A **comprehensive environmental assessment** would require incorporating these additional impact categories, which are beyond the current scope of _Carbon Brainprint_. This improvement is aimed at being integrated into next Carbon Brainprint release.

**3. Methodological Constraints**

Life cycle assessments (LCAs) inherently involve challenges that may influence the precision of calculations, including:

-   **System boundary definition:** Deciding which activities and emissions are within scope.
-   **Data source selection:** Balancing accuracy, availability, and representativeness of data.

These methodological considerations require **careful evaluation and transparency** to ensure reliable interpretations of the results.

By acknowledging these limitations, we encourage **continued improvement** of _Carbon Brainprint_ and its integration into more holistic sustainability strategies.

# V. Use Cases

We have already tested the robustness, replicability, and operational applicability of the _Carbon Brainprint_ tool across various brands within the Mantu Group, each with different business models but all focused on delivering intellectual services to clients. By reiterating calculations year after year, we have refined our reporting cycles and enhanced the tool’s comparability over time, thereby confirming its replicability.

To illustrate a concrete application of the tool, we present its implementation within one of Mantu’s flagship brands, **Amaris Consulting**. Since 2022, we have iterated through multiple calculation models and adapted the methodology, achieving a reliable and validated outcome.

Each year, we develop a customized _Carbon Brainprint_ calculator specifically for **Amaris Consulting**. This annual calculator is built based on:

-   **The Group’s carbon footprint report**, providing overarching sustainability insights.
-   **Amaris Consulting’s operational data**, including revenue, number of clients, employees, consultants, office occupancy rates, and other activity-based metrics.

Following the **ISO 14067** methodological framework, the calculator functions as a **systematic tool** for conducting life cycle analyses of carbon emissions. It integrates adjustable project-specific variables, ensuring precise carbon footprint assessments tailored to each case.

**Project-Specific Variables**

To ensure accurate carbon footprint assessments, _Carbon Brainprint_ considers the following project-specific variables:

-   **Client name**
-   **Number of working days** per consultant
-   **Amaris Consulting entity involved** and its geographic scope
-   **IT equipment source** – Is the equipment provided by Amaris Consulting or by the client?
-   **Remote work rate** – What percentage of time do consultants work remotely?
-   **Consultant commuting details:**

-   Daily distance traveled per consultant (in kilometers)
-   Modes of transport used (e.g., car, train, metro, bicycle, etc.)

-   **Business travel details:**

-   Was business travel involved?
-   If yes, what modes of transport were used?
-   Departure and arrival cities for each trip
-   Number of hotel nights and country of stay

Once the calculator is developed, it undergoes **external verification by an auditor** against ISO 14067 standards. This ensures compliance, methodological integrity, data quality and the reliability of the tool.

**Operational Integration**

Upon successful audit validation, the _Carbon Brainprint_ tool enters its operational phase, utilized at two critical stages of the project lifecycle:

1.  **Pre-sales Phase:**

-   The tool is seamlessly integrated into **existing sales and costing software**, allowing sales teams to calculate both the financial and environmental cost of a project in a **single interface**.
-   This eliminates redundant data entry and ensures that clients receive comprehensive insights, including a breakdown of the project’s projected carbon footprint alongside traditional cost assessments.

2.  **Project Conclusion & Reporting:**

-   To simplify reporting, we have developed an **automated workflow** using **Power Automate**.
-   Project managers can enter final physical data through a **user-friendly form**, capturing actual emissions data based on real project execution (e.g., duration, number of services provided, emissions from travel and office usage).
-   This form submission triggers an **automated data processing sequence**, which:

-   **Validates** and flags potential **data quality issues** for review by the Sustainability team.
-   **Processes** the carbon footprint calculation using the pre-validated methodology.
-   **Generates an automated Carbon Footprint Product Report**, which is shared with the client.

This **automated, robust, and seamless** system significantly reduces the risk of errors while ensuring that clients receive **accurate, complete, and standardized carbon data**. By facilitating the integration of this information into their **Scope 3 emissions reporting**, _Carbon Brainprint_ enhances transparency and promotes **industry-wide sustainability improvements**.
