# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

📌  **Who can use Carbon Brainprint?**

Any organization, researcher, or professional in the intellectual service industry can use this methodology to measure their carbon footprint.

📌  **Can I use this tool for commercial purposes?**

No. This project is licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA**, meaning it cannot be used for commercial purposes.

📌  **How can I contribute?**

Check out our [Contribution Guidelines] to see how you can help improve the methodology.

📌  **How is Carbon Brainprint different from other carbon footprint calculators?**

Unlike traditional methods that rely on financial ratios, Carbon Brainprint uses **physical data** for precise emissions calculations.

📌  **Who developed this methodology?**

This methodology was developed by **Mantu Group** and its brands (**Amaris Consulting, LittleBig Connection, Arneo, etc.**).

📌 **How to deal with multi-year projects?**

For projects extending beyond a single year, we ensure consistency in emission factors by using the latest available data from recognized sources, primarily the IPCC's reports and ADEME. This ensures that emission calculations remain accurate and reflective of current standards. All data sources and emission factors used are documented in the calculation tool and are accessible for review. This includes the specific version of the data source and the date it was last updated. For instance, if a project extends on the year 2024 and on 6 months of the year 2025 the data will be combined and extracted from the 2024 carbon Brainprint tool (using 2023 data) and at the end of the 6 months of 2025, using the 2025 carbon Brainprint tool (relying on 2024 data).
